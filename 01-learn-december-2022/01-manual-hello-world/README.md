## Steps:
- create a `main.rs` file 
- rust uses `.rs` extension
- fn -> function keyword
- main() -> entry point function of a rust file
- enclosed within `{}`
- println!() -> a rust macro that expands on compilation to its built-in fucntionality -> prints the argument passed to `stdout`
- ends with semi-colon

## Compilation:
- compile the file as `rustc main.rs`
- will generate an executable `main.exe`

## Run:
- `./main`
- Output will be seen in the stdout/ console
